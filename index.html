    The questions I wanted to answer started with a very simple question. What is the amount of penicilin in each bacteria? I wanted to graph out the amount in each bacteria first to get a broad understanding. I used a bar graph to present the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the problems with the graph is that the amount of penicillin between each bacteria varies, that the scale is way off. Bacteria such as Brucella anthracis has a value of 0.001 that it is almost impossible to see the line in the graph. However, any other graph will be the same for that matter. So to fix this I used a log scale to display the y-axis with a log scale. After I used a log scale the values were much more visibule. However, the only problem is that the viewer might miss read the data just by looking at this graph. Having twice the height of the graph does not mean that the amount is twice in value.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could not use a line graph because the individual values did not have any correlation with each other. Its does not represent any time.

  <p>
    Next, I the correlations between penicillin and streptomycin was a question that came to mind. So I decided to use a scatterplot to draw it out on the graph. I set the X-axis to streptomycin and the Y-axis to penicillin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I put the bacteria to each corresponding coordinates, I started to see patterns. But before that, I had to figure out how to make the marks larger, because the points' default size was too small. At first, I tried making the size of each marker equal to the value of the neomycin to present three values at the same time. However, when I applied it the bacterias with the values of 0.001 for neomycin would simply disappear. After making the markers larger, I saw that the graph was divided into three big groups by proximity. 
  </p>  
  <p>
    There is a large group near the origin (0, 0). Another group near the (2, 800) area. Last a group near (0, 12) area.

  <p>
    Last by examining the previous graph, I was getting more questions on the relationship of the three different groups. So for the last, graph I made a grouped bar chart grouped by Gram staining. Because I could not represent the Neomycin value as the size, I decided to make a graph putting the y-axis with the Neomycin value.
  </p>
  <p>
    It turns out that the group that was far to the right from the rest of the group was all positive in gram staining. The colors are equal in all three graphs so it is easy to track the different bacterias. Also, the batteries in the group that was in the upper area were all negative in gram staining. Half of the batteries near the origin was positive and the rest negative, so a strong correlation is hard to conclude for that group.
